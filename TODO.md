stuff that needs to be done
===========================

- [x] strings! (kinda?)

- [ ] control structs

- [ ] data structs

- [ ] functions / macros

- [ ] rewrite the logger so it's not a method of the stack, but its own class that implements python's logging

- [ ] source introspection

- [ ] arbitrary python execution

- [ ] mouse module loading

- [ ] multichar names

- [ ] a standard library

- [ ] rewrite README to match implementation
